As of today, Tailwind now includes [Decap](https://decapcms.org/) headless CMS !

## Why Decap ?[](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication)

[](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication)I chosed Decap CMS for the following reasons: 

1. Hosted with your website (You don't need to host it on a VPS)
2. FOSS (Free Open Source Software)
3. Easy enough to use and set-up



## How to use ?

To use it on your website, you should follow these [instructions ](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication)that includes setting up Netlify Identity and Github Gateway[](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication)[](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication)
